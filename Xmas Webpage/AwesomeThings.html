        <p style="font-size: 200%;">Hi Bryn, I know the season of Thanksgiving is over and it's the season of just giving, but since it is the season of giving I'd still like to give thanks.
            These past 42 (or 40 if you're reading this on the 23rd) days have been amazing and I am so grateful for you. I am so grateful that you always seek to hang out with me, that you're always willing to listen to me (even my rants), I am grateful that
            you're always willing to chat, even if it's a weird topic like dirt (which I think we actually have talked about before). You're such a smart and sweet person, and truly I'm grateful, and lucky, to have you.
            Thank you for being such a wonderful girlfriend to me and I look forward to all the memories to come (Currently thinking about baking cookies). Have a great Christmas Brynnn.</p>
