        <p style="font-size: 200%;">So I am always kind of at a loss for what to do for gifts, I currently have never asked for anything from my family since I was like 10 which I believe contributes to my terrible gift-giving skills... Not to make excuses though
            (even though Â I kind of just did... I thought about what I could do and I'm a geek so I made a website to display my 
            appreciation for you as well as because I knew it was something I could do (actually I couldn't build websites before but one all-nighter later and I learned enough!!!). Anyway,
            I hope you enjoy and Merry Christmass!!!).</p>
